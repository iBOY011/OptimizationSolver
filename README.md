## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

### Solving Optimization Problems
Once the app is running, you can:
1. Input the objective function.
2. Add constraints in the form of inequalities or equalities.
3. Select the type of optimization problem (linear/non-linear).
4. Solve the problem by clicking the "Solve" button.
5. View the results, which will be displayed on the screen, including the optimized values and graphical representations.

### Working with Constraints
Constraints are an essential part of optimization problems. In the app, you can:
- Add constraints for each problem.
- Specify the type of constraint (greater than, less than, equal).
- Visualize how different constraints impact the optimization process.
